### Project Vision (Your first task as a team)
We aim to build best-fit Event Management architecture and features within the NPSP framework.

Nonprofits have myriad needs related to Event Management, and continue to reinvent the wheel locally when creating their architecture, often needing to make revisions or complex work-arounds in order to connect to leading event management platforms that connect to Salesforce or which they aim to extract data from.

Our product is intended for nonprofit organizations with one-time or templated/recurring events with complexity that includes:
* Complexity Item 1
* Complexity Item 2
* Complexity Item 3
...but which does not include
* Descoped Need 1
* Descoped Need 2
* Descoped Need 3

While our current goals include just gelling on a best-fit schema and common fields, our future goals include: 
* revision of these objects and architecture to accomodate more common data points or "add-in" objects than anticipated
* data sets to help users leverage NPSP Data Import Batch architecture/features for loading data into the schema
* UI elements and automation to help end users engage with these objects who are NOT using connected platforms or are using a mixture of connected platform and localized entry

### Project Resources
* Group Chat room for project (active during sprints/meetings): https://kellpartners.quip.com/Puh2Ai2akiYx
* Current ERD: 

### Project Team Accomplishments during Philadelphia 2019 Sprint (Oct 17-18)
* Do we use Campaigns/Members or a Custom Object for the events themselves (See DECISION1 - CAMPAIGNS OR CUSTOM)
* What is the appropriate relationship of participants in events to events and amongst themselves (See DECISION2 - PARTICIPANT ARCHITECTURE)

### Future Contributions (Items we did not complete during the Sprint, but are roadmapping)
* Build suggested architecture as a deployment-ready package (including making field-level decisions about what is needed in the architecture)
* Create data set to help users leverage NPSP Data Import Batch features to perform ETL operations related to this architecture
* Create basic UI improvements and automations for common actions users will make related to events:
** UI Improvement/Action 1
** UI Improvement/Action 2
** UI Improvement/Action 3
