Project:Event Management

Project Description: We are replicating the same ways of managing events over and over again. We are not able to share best practices or tools with nonprofits / education institutions in order to help them more quickly run effective events. Ideally, we want to leverage existing tools to better manage events and create an "Event Management" cookbook with best practices, timelines and tools for ROI / goal tracking. 

Project Audience: Event planners, marketers

Project Team: Esteban Dozsa, Deb Van Zegeren, Punita Virkud, Deidre Callahan, Prince Sadie, Alexandra Laxmi Iyer

Contributing: TBD - If someone were to contribute to this project at the next Sprint what would you want them to work on to move this project forward?

Project Roadmap: TBD - What is the ultimate vision for this project?
