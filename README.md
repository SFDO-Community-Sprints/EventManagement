# Project: Event Management

Project Description: We are replicating the same ways of managing events over and over again. We are not able to share best practices or tools with nonprofits / education institutions in order to help them more quickly run effective events. Ideally, we want to leverage existing tools to better manage events and create an "Event Management" cookbook with best practices, timelines and tools for ROI / goal tracking. This group will propose architecture for various event management tasks as well as, time permitting, create objects that are needed. The output will be a cookbook (event management best practices) with recipes (proposed architecture or a package for event management tasks).

# Project Audience: 
Small non profit or education organizations that need a simple event solution, organizations that are looking for a starting place for more complex event management. Organizations that require registration for free events.

# Project Team: 
Esteban Dozsa, Deb Van Zegeren, Punita Virkud, Deidre Callahan, Prince Sadie, Alexandra Laxmi Iyer, Michael Slawnik, Bill Florio, Sara Chieco
