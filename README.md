### Project Vision (Your first task as a team)
We aim to build best-fit Event Management architecture and features within the NPSP framework.

Nonprofits have myriad needs related to Event Management, and continue to reinvent the wheel locally when creating their architecture, often needing to make revisions or complex work-arounds in order to connect to leading event management platforms that connect to Salesforce or which they aim to extract data from.

Our product is intended for nonprofit organizations with one-time or templated/recurring events with complexity that includes:
* Complexity Item 1
* Complexity Item 2
* Complexity Item 3
...but which does not include
* Descoped Need 1
* Descoped Need 2
* Descoped Need 3

While our current goals include just gelling on a best-fit schema and common fields, our future goals include: 
* revision of these objects and architecture to accomodate more common data points or "add-in" objects than anticipated
* data sets to help users leverage NPSP Data Import Batch architecture/features for loading data into the schema
* UI elements and automation to help end users engage with these objects who are NOT using connected platforms or are using a mixture of connected platform and localized entry

### Project Resources

### Project Team Accomplishments
* Prolems solved or addressed during Philadelphia 2019 Sprint (Oct 17-18):
** Do we use Campaigns/Members or a Custom Object for the events themselves (See DECISION1 - CAMPAIGNS OR CUSTOM)
** What is the appropriate relationship of participants in events to events and amongst themselves (See DECISION2 - PARTICIPANT ARCHITECTURE)

### Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
Often, it takes multiple Sprints to contribute an idea back into the Community. What happens at a Sprint does not stay at a Sprint! If someone were to contribute to this project at the next Sprint what would you want them to work on to move this project forward?<br><br>
* What is your project's Roadmap?

**Important**: If you have specific asks to help move this project forward we would recommend that you list them here, but also create separate Issues for each and add the label of "help wanted". This is a well-worn best practice for projects living in GitHub.
