# Project: Event Management

Project Description: We are replicating the same ways of managing events over and over again. We are not able to share best practices or tools with nonprofits / education institutions in order to help them more quickly run effective events. Ideally, we want to leverage existing tools to better manage events and create an "Event Management" cookbook with best practices, timelines and tools for ROI / goal tracking. This group will propose architecture for various event management tasks as well as, time permitting, create objects that are needed. The output will be a cookbook (event management best practices) with recipes (proposed architecture for event management tasks).

# Project Audience: Event planners, marketers
