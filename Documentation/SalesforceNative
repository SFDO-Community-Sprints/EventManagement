POSSIBLE MODEL:

IMAGE

Campaign Event (can be used for reporting)

Campaign Members (attendee, volunteer, sponsor - add a field or record type to differentiate). 
Can be used to track recruitment, list emails + email templates (invitations).

Opportunity (paid attendees, comp'ed attendees and / or sponsorships)

Accounts (vendors) - separate, this solution is not ideal

Account = venue 

Group Registrations: Will not work in this model

Tasks / Coordnation as tasks on the campaign, due dates, owners. However we can not templatize this

Problems with this model:
Timelines will not be easily templated in this model (explore solutions)
Table seating does not work in this model
Public calendars will not work in this model (may need communities)
