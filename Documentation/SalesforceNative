POSSIBLE MODEL:

Inline-style: 
![alt text](Images/SalesforceNativeWhiteboard.jpg "Salesforce Native Objects Whiteboard")

Campaign Event (can be used for reporting)

Campaign Members (attendee, volunteer, sponsor - add a field or record type to differentiate). 
Can be used to track recruitment, list emails + email templates (invitations).

Opportunity (paid attendees, comp'ed attendees and / or sponsorships)

Accounts (vendors) - separate, this solution is not ideal

Account = venue 

Group Registrations: Will not work in this model

Campaign Tasks: Tasks / Coordnation as tasks on the campaign, due dates, owners. However we can not templatize this

Campaign Chatter: Use chatter with topics on Post-event debriefs, creation of best practices

Campaign Cases: Possible for tracking vendors (relationship between the campaign and vendor recording both good and bad).

Problems with this model:
Timelines will not be easily templated in this model (explore solutions)
Table seating does not work in this model
Public calendars will not work in this model (may need communities)
