POSSIBLE MODEL:

IMAGE

Campaign Event
Campaign Members (attendee, volunteer, sponsor - add a field or record type to differentiate)
Opportunity (paid attendees or sponsorships)
Accounts (vendors) - separate, this solution is not ideal
Accounts as venue 
Group Registrations: Will not work in this model
Tasks / Coordnation as tasks on the campaign, due dates, owners. However we can not templatize this
Timelines (explore solutions)
Table seating does not work in this model.
